# Arduino Learning Journey Repository

![Arduino Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Arduino_Logo.svg/200px-Arduino_Logo.svg.png)

This repository serves as a track of my Arduino learning journey. It contains various projects and code files that I have completed during my Arduino lessons. As I progress in my learning, I will be adding more projects to this repository to showcase my development and newfound knowledge.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `.vscode`: This folder contains configuration files related to the Visual Studio Code editor settings. These settings are used to enhance my coding experience during Arduino development.

- `build`: This folder is used to store build-related files and outputs. It is generally automatically generated by the Arduino IDE or build systems.

- `projects`: This folder represents one of the projects I have completed during my Arduino lessons. I will create separate folders like this for each completed lesson, with each folder containing the corresponding Arduino sketch and a descriptive `README.md` file.

- `Arduino.ino`: This is the main Arduino sketch file. However, in this repository, it remains empty as it serves as the starting point for my current projects. As I complete lessons, I will move the finalized sketches to the corresponding project folders.

## How to Navigate the Repository

Each project folder under the `projects` directory will have its own `README.md` file that provides a detailed explanation of the project, including the purpose, circuit setup, code explanation, and any additional notes. The `.ino` files in these folders will contain the completed Arduino sketches for each project.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders and their `README.md` files to learn more about each Arduino project I have completed. Additionally, you can check out the commit history to track the progress of my learning journey and see how the repository evolves over time.

## About Me

I'm passionate about electronics and programming, and I've decided to embark on an exciting Arduino learning journey. Through this repository, I hope to not only document my progress but also share my experiences and knowledge with others who are also interested in Arduino development.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback on any of the projects or my learning journey, feel free to reach out. I'm open to learning from the community and making improvements along the way.
